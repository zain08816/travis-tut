# ci and automated testing tutorial
automated testing allows us to make scripts to automatically test our code
this makes it easy to find bugs we may reintroduce to old code with future changes.

Continous Integration (CI) is when you set up a testing enviroment that can
automatically run tests once builds are pushed to github. you can then use
a github feature to potentially require a pull request passes all the tests before
it merges into master. this way you know master allways passes all the tests.

## setup
- make sure you have node installed (alteast v10)
- run `npm install`

## jest specifics
this tutorial uses the jest testing library, which automatically finds tests by looking
though the \_\_tests\_\_ folder. you can run the included test by executing `npm test`.
see `__tests__/sumtest.spec.json` for more details. also here is a good [reference](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/jest/) for more info

## travis specifics
once the travis integration is setup, travis will look at the travis.yml in your repo
for the steps to take in order to run your tests. travis also has the option `os: osx`
for runing tests in a macos enviroment https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/

## setting up travis for your fork
- go to [https://travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com)
- login with github
- add a new repository
- activate github app
- click on the travis-tut fork
- click on setings
- the default settings should be fine but you can also add enviroment variables to
  provide secrets that shouldn't be public that you need for testing. like api keys
- try pushing a change and watch it build
